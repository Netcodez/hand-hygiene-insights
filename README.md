# Handwashing Data Analysis
A data analysis project exploring the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates in healthcare settings, based on the historical data of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and his groundbreaking discoveries

## Introduction
This project, "Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing," reanalyzes the data that led Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis to discover the importance of handwashing. By examining historical data from the Vienna General Hospital, the project showcases the alarming number of deaths caused by childbed fever and demonstrates the significant reduction in mortality rates after the implementation of handwashing protocols. The analysis highlights the critical role of data visualization and statistical evidence in advocating for scientific advancements.

## Project Details
The project utilizes Jupyter Notebook and Python programming language for data analysis. It focuses on the following key steps:

- Introduction to Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and the problem of childbed fever.
- Analysis of yearly data on births and deaths at Vienna General Hospital to identify the proportion of deaths and understand the severity of the issue.
- Visualization of the proportion of deaths at Clinic 1 and Clinic 2 to explore any patterns or differences.
- Investigation into the potential causes of the higher mortality rate at Clinic 1 and the hypothesis of hand contamination.
- Examination of monthly data before and after the implementation of handwashing to assess its effect on reducing deaths.
- Highlighting the impact of handwashing on the proportion of deaths through data visualization.
- Calculation of the average reduction in deaths due to handwashing.
- Application of bootstrap analysis to estimate the uncertainty around the reduction in mortalities.
- Discussion on the significance of Semmelweis' findings and the challenges he faced in gaining acceptance within the medical community.
Technologies Used

The project relies on the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib

## How to Run the Code
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file, "Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing.ipynb," using Jupyter Notebook.
- Execute the code cells sequentially to observe the analysis results and visualizations.


## Conclusion
Through the analysis of historical data, this project emphasizes the critical role of handwashing in reducing mortality rates. The findings highlight the importance of evidence-based practices in healthcare and the need for effective communication of statistical results to drive scientific advancements. Despite the challenges faced by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, his work serves as a reminder of the transformative power of data analysis in improving public health.
